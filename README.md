# liamsalter11.github.io

This repository contains the source for [liamsalter.com](https://liamsalter.com), a simple static site hosted with **GitHub Pages**.

## Purpose

The site currently serves a single HTML page. GitHub Pages publishes the `main` branch and uses the `CNAME` file to point the site to the custom domain `liamsalter.com`.

## Updating the Site

1. Edit `index.html` (or add new files if needed).
2. Run `git status` to review your changes.
3. Commit the updates:
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "Describe your change"
   ```
4. Push the commit to GitHub. Once the commit reaches `main`, GitHub Pages will deploy automatically.

## Future Edits

To make further changes, repeat the steps above. Each commit will trigger GitHub Pages to rebuild the site at the custom domain.
